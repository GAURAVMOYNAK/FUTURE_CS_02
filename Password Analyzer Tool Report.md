# Password Analyzer Tool: Algorithm and Effectiveness Report

## 1. Introduction
The Password Analyzer Tool is designed to assess the strength of user-provided passwords and provide feedback on their security. The tool employs various criteria, including length, character diversity, and dictionary checks, to determine the robustness of a password.

## 2. Algorithm Explanation
The Password Analyzer Tool follows a step-by-step algorithm to evaluate password strength:

### **Step 1: Input Collection**
- The user inputs a password for analysis.

### **Step 2: Length Evaluation**
- The password length is checked and categorized:
  - Weak: Less than 8 characters
  - Moderate: 8-12 characters
  - Strong: More than 12 characters

### **Step 3: Character Composition Analysis**
- The password is analyzed for the presence of different character types:
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&* etc.)
- A password containing all these categories is considered stronger.

### **Step 4: Dictionary Word Check**
- The password is compared against a dictionary of commonly used or weak passwords (e.g., "password123", "qwerty").
- If the password exists in the dictionary, it is flagged as weak.

### **Step 5: Repetitive and Sequential Character Detection**
- The tool checks for sequences such as "123456" or repeated characters like "aaaaaa" and penalizes such passwords.

### **Step 6: Entropy Calculation**
- The entropy of the password is calculated using:
  
  \[ H = L \times log_2(N) \]
  
  where:
  - **H** is the entropy (measured in bits)
  - **L** is the length of the password
  - **N** is the possible number of characters per position

- Higher entropy indicates a stronger password.

### **Step 7: Strength Scoring and Feedback**
- A final score is computed based on all the previous checks.
- The tool provides feedback to the user, such as:
  - "Your password is weak. Consider adding numbers and special characters."
  - "Your password is strong. Keep it safe!"

## 3. Effectiveness of the Algorithm
The algorithm ensures a thorough assessment of password strength by:

1. **Encouraging Best Practices**: It enforces industry standards like using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
2. **Preventing Common Weaknesses**: The tool detects dictionary words, sequences, and repeated characters.
3. **Entropy-Based Analysis**: It quantifies password strength mathematically rather than relying solely on predefined rules.
4. **Providing User-Friendly Feedback**: Instead of just labeling a password as weak or strong, it gives actionable suggestions.

## 4. Conclusion
The Password Analyzer Tool effectively evaluates password strength by considering multiple factors such as length, character diversity, entropy, and common weaknesses. By implementing this tool, users can create stronger passwords, enhancing their overall cybersecurity posture.
